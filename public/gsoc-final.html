<h1 id="gsoc-2023-final-post">GSoC 2023: Final Post</h1>
<p>Hello there! This is the last in series of blogposts detailing the
all the work I have been doing for the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a> as part of Google
Summer of Code 2023.</p>
<p>This will serve as a complete summary of the work I did, the things I
learned along the way, and the work that remains.</p>
<h2 id="brief-intro-on-my-project">Brief Intro on My Project</h2>
<p>The project I was selected for is titled “Arti API exploration to
build example tools”.</p>
<p>Confused? Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arti is the Rust rewrite of the Tor software that allows you to
make TCP connections through the Tor Network, run Tor relays and bridges
etc. You can read more about it <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti">from its
repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Arti was built in mind with the goal that other developers should
be able to use Arti to build Tor-powered software, and has incorporated
that thinking into its design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, it exports some crates that other developers can use in their
Rust projects, and has some documentation on them, including some basic
demonstration code snippets that you can follow along with at home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Arti is a fairly bleeding-edge project. It didn’t hit
version 1.0.0 too long ago, and due to the breakneck speed of
development, APIs are not set in stone. There is a lot of breakage that
could be potentially encountered by another developer.</p></li>
<li><p>This, in this project, I created certain sample programs in Rust
using Arti’s APIs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal is to build my sample programs and document any difficulties
that come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe certain APIs are hard to use, or undocumented, or certain
operations cause Arti to fail (exposing a bug). All these issues were
brought to the notice of the Arti team and fixes were discussed and
implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the project can get valuable feedback from an outsider
who doesn’t have much knowledge of the codebase and the way the Arti
proxy does things.</p>
<h2 id="the-sample-projects">The Sample Projects</h2>
<p>The sample projects I ended up creating were:</p>
<ul>
<li>A download manager that used Arti to create six simultaneous
connections to connect to the Tor Project’s website and download a
hardcoded version of the Linux version of the Tor Browser Bundle, and
also verify its SHA256 checksum.</li>
</ul>
<p>This could also theoretically be distributed to people living in
countries where the normal distribution methods for the Tor Browser may
be banned or blocked by authorities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A DNS resolver that uses a bespoke DNS over TCP implementation to
connect to Cloudflare’s DNS server over the Tor network. This project
mainly illustrates the usage of a custom TCP-based protocol over Tor, in
the hopes that people wishing to tunnel arbitrary streams over Tor can
see how much (or rather, how little) work would go into making this
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>A connection checker, which is just a small tool that tries to
connect to Tor through various means, including pluggable transports. It
was the first project that was utilizing the pluggable transport portion
of the Arti crates.</p></li>
<li><p>An obfs4 connection tool, which was not only a sample project,
but also a vital new addition to the Tor Project’s arsenal for
monitoring the health of the Tor network. This tool sets up a RESTful
API which can continuously check on the health of various obfs4 bridges
fed to it, and report these statuses. A client program can feed it
bridges to monitor and poll an updates endpoint for getting the updated
statuses of these bridges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This project required exposing some APIs or attributes from Arti in
order to create channels (which are direct, encrypted connections that
only carry Tor protocol messages) to each bridge we need to test.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small program called pt-proxy, which creates a SOCKS5 proxy server
and client tunnelled over the obfs4 protocol in order to avoid
censorship of the connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project necessitated adding basic APIs to set up an obfs4
subprocess in server mode. I had to look at <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/main/pt-spec.txt">pt-spec.txt</a>,
which defines the spec for how Tor/Arti and pluggable transports
interact with each other, and then modify the <a
href="https://lib.rs/crates/tor-ptmgr">tor-ptmgr</a> crate to perform
the required operations. (more on this later)</p>
<p>Note that these projects have been reviewed multiple times by <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/gabi-250">gabi</a> and <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/nickm">nickm</a> (aka Nick, who was
my mentor this year). Many capabilities, docs, code restructurings etc
are a result of their suggestions. Thank you very much!</p>
<h2 id="bugs-found">Bugs Found</h2>
<p>Now, part of the reason why these sample projects were being created
is to see what an external developer, like me, who has no prior
experience or knowledge of Arti or its internals, would be able to
accomplish using these APIs and what hurdles would they run into during
the course of creating the sample projects.</p>
<p>Some of those hurdles are documented below in the form of bug reports
I filed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/779">SQLite
error on making repeated requests</a>: this was the first bug I filed,
and I found it on the same day I started experimenting with Arti’s APIs!
(This was before the GSoC period formally began, but I think it still
counts). Essentially, you are not supposed to create two
<code>TorClient</code>s in Arti, because Arti has a shared state
directory that it can’t manage very well under that configuration. This
bug arises as a side effect of that, and while it isn’t best practice,
it was still a valid bug in the code nonetheless. nickm would later <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1055">fix</a>
this issue.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/875">Add
example code to use Snowflake based bridges in arti-client</a>: this was
filed because I myself did not find any good guidance through the
existing docs on how I can launch a connection via the Snowflake
pluggable transport. <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/trinity-1686a">trinity</a> would end
up <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1216">fixing</a>
this disparity.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/879">Mention
Pluggable Transports are not a part of Arti</a>: this may sound very
trivial, but the devil’s in the details. Someone who may wish to use
Arti may not necessarily be aware that pluggable transports aren’t a
part of Arti (or even the original C Tor codebase), but are rather
maintained separately and are launched as subprocesses by the parent
Arti/Tor process. trinity ended up fixing this in the same MR as the one
linked for the previous bug.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/924">TorClientBuilder
doesn’t implement Send</a>: yet another concurrency bug, this one was
fairly straightforward: the <code>TorClientBuilder</code> needed to be
marked as <code>Send</code> (it is a marker trait saying “whichever
struct is marked Send can be sent across threads safely”) and not
<code>!Send</code> (which says “don’t implement Send for this struct”).
The <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1307">fix</a>
involved just marking <code>TorClientBuilder</code> as
<code>Send + Sync</code> and adding a test which fails if this is
violated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are some open issues I filed as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/927">Allow
ChanMgr to expire a specific channel immediately</a></p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/995">Make
ErrorReport not be Sized so we can return Box<dyn ErrorReport> for Arti
errors</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="merge-requests-created">Merge Requests Created</h2>
<p>I also ended up creating and getting many Merge Requests merged into
Arti. These gradually transitioned from trivial to non-trivial. Some of
these were code or doc fixes for bugs I filed myself, while others were
feature requests for exposing a capability that a sample project would
require.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1037">Use
humantime in tor-checkable and tor-guardmgr</a>: my first MR to Arti
involved just adjusting times used for testing to be human-readable in
the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339">RFC3339</a> format.
The times used in this MR were all historic moments where the people
would gain freedom. I found this quite touching.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1042">Remove
unnecessary warning from arti-hyper/README</a>: another beginner level
MR to Arti, this just involved removing a warning from arti-hyper (a
crate from Arti) that referenced a TLS issue on macOS that was later
worked around.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1172">Change
log levels of messages from INFO to others</a>: this MR involved
changing the log level of three log messages to <code>debug</code> and
add two warnings. This was done to not unnecessarily give scary messages
to a normal end user who runs Arti at the default <code>info</code> log
level.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1213">Expand
arti-client docs to include error reporting section</a>: during
development, I was made aware that Arti had an <code>ErrorReport</code>
trait implemented by all the Arti errors which allowed you to get a
pretty-printed error message by calling the <code>report()</code>
method. It would also generate error messages that would be easier to
copy-paste into bug reports and to read, so I created an MR to inform
any user reading <code>arti-client</code> docs about utilizing this
functionality.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1229">Add
error if [[bridges.transports]] isn’t written in config file</a>: while
learning more about how PTs are configured in Arti, I noticed a bug
which allowed invalid configuration files to be used. The <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1229">bug</a>
is triggered when one specified a bridge in <code>[bridges]</code>
section of arti.toml but commented out
<code>[[bridges.transports]]</code> entirely. It would end up trying to
connect to Tor but never work, and would output cryptic panic errors
instead.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The MR, after being discussed and reviewed thoroughly by <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/Diziet">Diziet</a>, would end up
being merged, adding the fix as well as test cases which will help catch
this bug if there is a regression in the future. (Thank you Diziet for
all the suggestions!)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1273">Remove
message ‘For now, only direct channels are supported’ in tor-chanmgr
docs</a>: As I was exploring <code>tor-chanmgr</code> crate, I found
that the docs were not consistent with the progress that had been made
in Arti. The docs erroneously said that only direct channels (ie,
channels to normal relays in the Tor network) were supported, when in
fact the crate had since gained support for creating channels to bridges
using any supported pluggable transport. I fixed this
inconsistency.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1275">Create
chanmgr() method in TorClient</a>: This small MR just exposes the
<code>ChanMgr</code> (it helps create channels) from
<code>TorClient</code> (which helps us avoid writing the instantiation
code ourselves). It was done in order for obfs4 checker to work, since
obfs4 checker just builds channels to bridges rather than building an
entire circuit.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1316">Add
Channel expiry info in ChanMgr docs</a>: after some discussion on how
channels expire on IRC, I transcribed this info as best I could in the
docs. <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/nickm">nickm</a> also
created a <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1318">similar
MR</a> based on this MR with more info.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1504">Add
initial support for running a PT in server mode</a>: this MR adds
low-level support for spawning a pluggable transport process with the
required environment variables to operate in server mode, ie, it will
listen for incoming connections made using the pluggable transport
protocol, decode them and pass them onto a specified destination, where
they can be processed accordingly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This work enables the <code>pt-proxy</code> sample project to work.
It is the largest MR I’ve made to Arti to date, and involved the most
work to write.</p>
<p>The following two MRs were merged but their work was later undone as
it was deemed unnecessary:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1374">Expose
channel builder in order to create channels more efficiently in external
code</a></p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1403">Gate
builder() behind experimental-api feature</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work-left">Work Left</h2>
<p>All that is currently left is to get final reviews from the Arti
developers and open an MR to merge my work, which currently lives in <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/gotlou/arti-sample-project">a
dedicated repo</a>, into the main <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti">Arti repo</a>.</p>
<p>After some discussion with the developers, it was decided that these
example projects will exist in a top-level <code>examples/</code>
directory.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>I had an overwhelmingly positive experience in GSoC this year. Here’s
a brief, non-exhaustive list why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got to learn about technical details from the Arti developers,
everything from writing good docs, naming things properly, to code
architecture. Code reviews were easily some of the best parts of GSoC
for this reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I only picked up Rust in the near past, I’ve ended up learning
a lot of advanced Rust-isms from working on this project as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I learned a lot about communicating across timezones, cultures
etc. and using less ambiguous language in discussions to get my point
across in a clearer manner. People tend to neglect the human aspect of
open source development, but in my opinion, it is almost impossible for
a good developer to not have good communication skills, especially
proficiency in written English.</p></li>
<li><p>I was given a ton of autonomy when it came to accomplishing my
goals, and whenever I needed help I would get really good advice. This
helped me develop my own research and self-learning skills further,
while also being able to learn from my mentors in case a problem was too
specific to this project to reason about alone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This didn’t mean I only popped up when things went wrong, though; I
always made sure to update Nick about my plans for the week every
Monday, which gave him the chance to suggest changes if my approach was
flawed and to keep track of my progress.</p>
<ul>
<li>It felt very good to see pieces of code I wrote merged into a big
project, where it will end up doing some good to the world, especially
for Arti, where this code will eventually be used in sitations to guard
freedom and the free flow of information, much to the chagrin of
repressive regimes and iron-fisted ISPs alike.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am extremely thankful for this opportunity, and I hope that my work
has been helpful to Arti and the Tor Project. I’ve ended up learning a
lot, and it is in no small part due to the help I’ve gotten from all the
developers I ended up interacting with (special mentions to nickm,
Diziet, gabi, trinity, arma, shelikhoo, eta, ahf, and meskio)</p>
<p>I’ve gained a ton of confidence in developing and contributing to
open source projects of varying scales, and I hope to continue the good
work started and outlined here in the future as well.</p>
