  Services Again</h1>
<h2 id="an-update-to-attempt-to-de-google">An update to attempt to
  De-Google</h2>
<p>It has been quite a long time <a href="microg-review.html">(3+
    years!)</a> since I last shared info on my personal experiences with <a href="https://microg.org">MicroG</a>, the
  free and open source software
  that provides a replacement for Google Play libraries that most apps
  that are practically required to exist in today’s society rely on, but
  with the bonus that 1. they don’t spy on you and relay creepy info back
  to Google, and 2. also come with just enough instability to make using a
  new app equal parts exciting and dreadful (bonus if the app has anything
  to do at all with payments, finance or some sort of security).</p>
<p>A lot has changed since then. When I first published the article in
  2022, the pandemic lockdown was just receeding for me. I was yet to even
  join college, so at home, I rarely used my phone. However, once I
  stepped out of my house, I had to keep this device on me almost at all
  times so that I could keep updated with whatever was happening at home
  and at college, and also be able to pay for travel, food etc on my own,
  mostly cashless in the form of UPI.</p>
<p>This meant installing more apps, using those apps more and generally
  being steered to use apps that relied on Google Play Services more.</p>
<p>In addition, Google themselves started tightening the screws, most
  recently with Play Integrity, which acts as a replacement for the
  outgoing SafetyNet API. This is a draconian, pathetic attempt at
  security which ends up stating that anything the manufacturer and Google
  ship the phone with is secure. This is completely incorrect. The current
  system deems a phone with an older Android version but a passing Play
  Integrity check more secure than one running the latest Android but on a
  custom ROM. The only thing Play Integrity is able to say that I also
  agree with is that if it passes, the phone is in a “stock” mode and
  conforms to the Google standards and thus can be shipped with Google
  services out of the box.</p>
<p>Play Integrity, sadly is being used in a wide variety of apps, the
  most egregious of which includes McDonald’s. Apparently those fast food
  deals are just worth the extra protection from malicious apps I
  guess.</p>
<p>So, given all of this, how has my experience fared? Fairly decent, I
  would say. I’ll give some up-to-date info on the apps first and then
  detail my personal history.</p>
<h3 id="banking-apps">Banking Apps</h3>
<p>Let’s get this one right out of the way. My banking apps work, but
  your mileage may vary. This will depend on your bank, though! Mine were
  fine, though interestingly enough one started to stop working after an
  update on my old phone, though installing a ROM and MicroG on my new
  phone did not yield the same result even though both were aftermarket
  operating systems that did not pass Play Integrity. Maybe it was using
  some other integrity measure? I don’t know.</p>
<p>As for UPI payment apps, I use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PayTM: works fine, though recently I have seen that if a UPI request
    is sent online over to the app, it complains about non manufacturer OS
    and stops the payment flow. However, payments launched through another
    app intent on Android, scanning a QR code or entering a phone number all
    work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, when setting it up on my new phone, it did in fact prevent me
  from signing up, but downgrading the APK to one from circa May or June
  2025 worked, and updating did not kick me out either.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Cred: works without any issues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>BHIM: used to work until the big redesign update, after which it
      needed Play Integrity. (I ended up spoofing Play Integrity and it works
      fine, though it seemingly can’t generate a QR code for others to
      scan)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amazon Pay UPI: signup complains about the app not being from Play
    Store. The wallet works though.</li>
</ul>
<p>These apps did not kick me out immediately upon trying to sign up,
  and so may or may not work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PhonePe</li>
  <li>WhatsApp Pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, while I did not try it for what should be obvious
  reasons, Google Pay (both the Indian UPI version and the global version,
  if they aren’t the same app anymore) usually won’t work on custom ROMs +
  MicroG.</p>
<h3 id="normal-apps">Normal Apps</h3>
<p>Most other apps are not nearly this finicky. Special mention once
  again to McDonald’s who, for the greater good, have painstakingly
  implemented seemingly one of the most advanced client attestation
  tooling into their app so that the chosen ones (running spyware and
  ad-ridden software) can securely order fast food at a seemingly cheap
  price.</p>
<p>Usually, if you enable everything in MicroG and still don’t log in,
  it is usually enough to get apps to work. Location and embedded maps
  used to be an issue but no longer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Until their switch to their own mapping provider, Ola Cabs did
      not work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trick I described in my old article about getting Google Maps
      to pick up my location still works if Maps did not pick up my location.
      Also I have yet to find a good alternative to Google Maps :(. Whenever I
      go to a new city, Google Maps ends up being the single most useful app
      on my phone to orient me efficiently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last time, I mentioned how I used some apps like GMail in the web
      browser. I still do this for GMail on one or two accounts, but for rest
      I am now using Thunderbird for Android, which allows me to quickly read
      and send email from a nice interface and a privacy-friendly client. For
      other apps like Uber, which I used to use in the web, I now use the app
      since a lot of their blockers (like the map API) have been resolved by
      MicroG.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some apps (shown above or below) will not work. For this it helps
      to have friends ;) or an older phone that can run stock operating
      systems that you can get your small task done on and then power
      off.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="government-apps">Government Apps</h3>
<p>These are very hit or miss, like banking. I haven’t used every single
  app out there, but this is my experience with the ones I have used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DigiLocker: complains about developer mode being on, but after
      disabling it, it works fine. The website is also fine if you need to
      just download docs, but the app is useful to show in place of a physical
      ID.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mAadhaar: complains about custom ROM and doesn’t work. The
      website works fine enough to lock/unlock biometrics etc, although there
      is a 2FA option that uses mAadhaar app as a TOTP replacement to log in
      as opposed to SMS-based 2FA.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>UMANG + Aadhaar FaceRD (not to be confused with mAadhaar): I had
      to use these two apps to create a UAN number. The Aadhaar FaceRD app
      does not work on MicroG, even with Play Integrity spoofing. I had to
      borrow someone else’s phone for this step. However, the UMANG app seems
      to work fine.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As always, I recommend checking out <a href="https://plexus.techlore.tech/">Plexus</a> for a lot of these apps
  to see if it is just you experiencing issues or if there is a genuine
  app incompatibility. Once again, I cannot recommend MicroG for an
  average user since it doesn’t cover every single use case in every
  single scenario. However, if privacy is important for you and you can’t
  or won’t give up using some of the big apps that most people use, then
  MicroG strikes a really good balance between privacy and normalcy. For
  me, it makes me feel a lot better about using a phone whenever I have
  to, knowing that there is far less creepy data being sent around about
  my usage.</p>
<p>This is a tumultuous time for custom ROMs, MicroG and other
  modifications in the Android app ecosystem. Just yesterday, Google
  detailed how it planned to disallow apps from unverified developers from
  running on certified Android devices, taking one more step towards the
  growing iOS-ification of Android, a trend where Android increasingly
  becomes more locked down and more power rests in the hands of Google, a
  sharp contrast from the olden days of maybe 10+ years ago when Nexus
  phones ruled in the minds and hearts of Android enthusiasts, almost
  every phone’s bootloader was promptly unlocked and a Cyanogenmod ROM was
  flashed.</p>
<p>It is going to be interesting for sure to see how things turn out,
  but I am glad that some people are doing their best to fight back
  against this trend.</p>
