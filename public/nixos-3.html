<h1 id="migrating-to-nixos-part-3">Migrating to NixOS (Part 3)</h1>
<h2 id="customization-to-the-next-level">Customization to the next
level</h2>
<p>It’s been a while since I’ve posted on this series, but a lot has
changed in that time. I’ve managed to learn more Nix and become more
comfortable with the ecosystem, which has allowed me to make more
changes to my system.</p>
<p>While these changes are less NixOS-specific, it seems much harder to
me to be able to do and more importantly, maintain them without Nix.</p>
<p>This post will just be a brief list of all the changes I’ve ended up
implementing. If you want to follow along at home and copy my configs,
you can get my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~gotlou/nix-config">NixOS
config</a>, clone and search for the required settings.</p>
<h3 id="downloading-more-ram-no-really">Downloading more RAM (no
really)</h3>
<p><a href="">zram</a> is a nifty feature which requires the sacrifice
of some RAM and then using this RAM to create a compressed swap device
in memory. In my current config, I have given 1 gigabyte of RAM in
exchange for 20 gigabytes of zram, which helps mitigate OOM freezes, and
helps speed up some big compilations.</p>
<h3 id="oom">OOM</h3>
<p>Speaking of OOM, rather than using <code>systemd-oomd</code>, which
didn’t seem to have much of an effect for me, I switched to <a
href="https://github.com/rfjakob/earlyoom">earlyoom</a>, which ended up
solving the “system freezes under load” problem for me. The worst I see
now is that my system becomes a bit less responsive, especially during
linking.</p>
<h3 id="no-global-programming-tools">No global programming tools</h3>
<p>I also decided to embrace Nix dev shells and removed almost all of my
development tools from my user install, instead using per-project flakes
to install stuff like the Rust toolchain, C compilers, debuggers, LSPs
etc. This also allowed me to configure <a href="">mold</a> as the
default linker for C/C++/Rust projects, which gives me a nice speedup
during linking.</p>
<p>In the future, I would like to have these per-project flakes serve as
an easy way to sandbox my developer environments, such that as soon as I
enter these directories and the flake loads, I can enter a less
privileged environment. One of the flaws with the way <a
href="https://git.sr.ht/~gotlou/code-sandbox"><code>code-sandbox</code></a>
does it is that it is a very rigid shell script. A Nix module that can
be applied and adjusted per flake would be much better (for example,
does it require IPC access? does it need Wayland or sound?)</p>
<h3 id="cli-improvements">CLI improvements</h3>
<p>I’ve replaced some of the GNU coreutils with Rust rewrites for
getting a faster, more modern equivalent. Some of these are also aliased
so typing <code>ls</code> actually triggers <code>eza</code>, for
example.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat"><code>bat</code></a>
instead of <code>cat</code> (I liked it so much I now use
<code>bat</code> as my pager instead of less)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eza-community/eza"><code>eza</code></a>
instead of <code>ls</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bootandy/dust"><code>dust</code></a>
instead of <code>du</code> (this runs much faster than the normal
<code>du</code>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta"><code>delta</code></a>
instead of <code>diff</code> for rendering pretty diffs with colors</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep"><code>rg</code></a>
instead of <code>grep</code> (I earlier had this aliased but now I never
type <code>grep</code>, <code>rg</code> is smaller to type anyways)</li>
<li>I also installed <a
href="https://github.com/lotabout/skim"><code>sk</code></a>, which is a
Rust replacement for <code>fzf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have an alias called <code>scanfor</code> which allows me to use
<code>sk</code> and ripgrep to search in all text files contained in a
folder recursively and open that file up in Helix. This means if I’m not
sure about where I have <code>services.syncthing</code> defined in my
Nix config repo, I can type <code>scanfor</code> and search for
<code>services.syncthing</code>. A press of the Enter key will open the
required file in Helix. This has served me well a lot, and its
usefulness scales with the size of the project I would work on.</p>
<p>Similar to this, I also have the <code>.</code> alias, which just
runs <code>hx .</code>. This opens up the Helix file picker at the
current folder, allowing me to search by file name and open that
file.</p>
<p>There are also some aliases which shorten <code>nixos-rebuild</code>
commands, so I can execute them from anywhere in my filesystem and have
easy commands for switching to a new NixOS config, or updating my
system.</p>
<p>I also have my prompt configured using <a
href="https://starship.rs/">starship</a>, which looks better than the
bash default.</p>
<p><a href="https://magit.vc/"><code>magit</code></a> was also added
(via an opinionated config with Vim keybindings) via an overlay. Though
I don’t use <code>magit</code> much in daily practice, it has come in
handy for speeding up some more complicated git operations.</p>
<h3 id="security-enhancements">Security enhancements</h3>
<p>I’ve switched to using <code>doas</code> instead of <code>sudo</code>
for commands that need elevated permissions. From my simple uses (and
for the majority of single user Linux desktop users) <code>doas</code>
is more than enough, and it has a much smaller codebase, with a lot less
attack surface, which makes it a more secure utility.</p>
<p>I finally enabled the firewall on my system, and have ports open for
KDE Connect, Syncthing etc.</p>
<p>I have a custom KeepassXC overlay (basically, an overlay is a way you
can modify a Nix function) which disables X11 and networking support, so
it can only run as a Wayland program and only make Unix sockets (for
communication with browser extension).</p>
<p>I replaced the default NTP daemon on my system
(<code>systemd-timesyncd</code>) with <a
href="https://chrony-project.org/"><code>chrony</code></a>, since chrony
has support for NTS (Network Time Security), which reduces the chances
that an attacker can manipulate the time on my system by spoofing NTP
packets.</p>
<p>I also took this time to learn a bit more about systemd service
hardening, and used that knowledge (and a ton of trial and error) to
sandbox some services, such as Tailscale, such that they don’t have
access to my private files and any permissions that they don’t really
need.</p>
<h3 id="home-manager-2-electric-boogaloo">Home Manager 2: Electric
Boogaloo</h3>
<p>I’ve also restarted using <a
href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">Home Manager</a>
for config file management. I had removed Home Manager from my config
earlier since it wasn’t working properly when I moved my NixOS system
config to flakes, but now I’ve added it as a NixOS module, which means
that whenever I need to make a change in Home Manager, I have to rebuild
my system.</p>
<p>I’ve ended up moving most, if not all of my configs to Home Manager,
including ones for:</p>
<ul>
<li>git</li>
<li>wezterm (I’ve made it more minimal than what it is by default)</li>
<li>helix</li>
<li>htop (copied and pasted config into Home Manager and made it
immutable)</li>
<li>All my shell aliases and configs are also configured using Home
Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also been able to house my KDE Plasma config in Nix as well,
thanks to the excellent <a
href="https://github.com/pjones/plasma-manager">plasma-manager</a>
module. This, combined with creating immutable config files for certain
Plasma/KDE programs not covered by <code>plasma-manager</code>, has led
me to have virtually my entire desktop config within Nix. I even have
two Plasma plugins as git submodules within my Nix config repo.</p>
<p>Anything not in Home Manager is covered by Impermanence, and if some
data isn’t covered by either of these, it is either non-config personal
data, like pictures and personal files, or it doesn’t matter ;)</p>
<h3 id="key-remapping">Key Remapping</h3>
<p>I tried out <a
href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd"><code>keyd</code></a>, which is a
pretty simple program that helps you remap keys for custom shortcuts
etc.</p>
<p>I simply swap the Caps Lock and Escape keys, and the difference is
truly night and day. It took me maybe a week or two to fully train my
fingers to not instinctively press the actual Escape key in Helix and
instead go for the Caps Lock key.</p>
<p>I also have a layer that activates when Caps Lock is held, and this
has let me map the h, j, k and l keys to be arrow keys. For example,
Caps Lock + h is equivalent to the left arrow key. This is a gamechanger
and lets me bring a little bit of Vim to every program.</p>
<h3 id="zfs">ZFS</h3>
<p>Truly “the last word in filesystems”, I decided to try out ZFS on my
machine, since I was becoming more concerned about the future of btrfs,
given that Red Hat dropped it from RHEL and the new kid on the block
seems to be bcachefs. ZFS also has native encryption, which seemed
intriguing, even if some metadata about the subvolumes (datasets in ZFS
parlance) is leaked. Using native encryption seemed to be the more
reliable option, since ZFS’ error correction can work with it, and there
is one less layer that can bork things. NixOS is also one of the few
Linux distros that has first-class ZFS support (ZFS is harder to set up
on other distros due to the complicated licensing issues preventing ZFS’
inclusion in the Linux kernel, but NixOS hand waves this away for you
and gives you ZFS support even in its default USB install media).</p>
<p>I don’t really use the advanced features of btrfs or ZFS outside of
creating subvolumes and enabling zstd compression on them, so I am a
poor judge of which filesystem is better. However, I feel more
comfortable with a ZFS install due to the above mentioned reasons.</p>
<h3 id="testing-out-reproducibility">Testing out Reproducibility</h3>
<p>After porting my <code>installnix.sh</code> script to create ZFS
partitions and use native encryption instead of LUKS, I ended up
reinstalling my system. Before reinstallation, I opted to only back up
my <code>/persist</code> and select parts of my home folder. I opted not
to back up any dotfile that wasn’t in <code>/persist</code>.</p>
<p>When the reinstall had been completed, I was only missing one or two
things, which was solved by getting the Nix repo back on my system and
rebooting (Plasma was missing the two plugins I have stored in my repo
as submodules)</p>
<h3 id="repo-refactoring">Repo refactoring</h3>
<p>There were a couple refactors in my Nix config repo to help organize
the code. I now try to have each service have its own file and import
that separately, which makes it super easy to make a service disappear
entirely from my system, simply by commenting it out. It also makes it
easy to paste snippets from others’ configs or let others copy my code
for their configs, as well as share some configs between different NixOS
configurations. This is how my Raspberry Pi config lives off a lot of
the same config as my main machine’s config.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve ended up making quite a lot of changes in my system, and the
best part is that these are stable changes; an OS update isn’t going to
wipe them out, or have me tweak a new setting. Even if something like
this is required, it will go inside a git repo and not an undocumented,
obscure path in the traditional FHS where I will forget all about
it.</p>
<p>I also feel far more comfortable trying out experimental software or
new tools in my workflow, like <code>keyd</code>, on NixOS since I know
I can always rollback to the old method by reverting some commits or
rebooting.</p>
