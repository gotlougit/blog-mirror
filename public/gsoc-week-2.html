<h1 id="gsoc-2023-blog-2">GSoC 2023 Blog 2</h1>
<p>Hello there! This is the second in a series of blogposts detailing
the work I will be doing for the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a> as part of Google
Summer of Code 2023.</p>
<p>Here I will detail some of the work I did during some period of time,
the challenges I faced and the outcomes of that work.</p>
<h2 id="brief-intro-on-my-project">Brief Intro on My Project</h2>
<p>The project I was selected for is titled “Arti API exploration to
build example tools”.</p>
<p>Confused? Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arti is the Rust rewrite of the Tor software that allows you to
make TCP connections through the Tor Network, run Tor relays and bridges
etc. You can read more about it <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti">from its
repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Arti was built in mind with the goal that other developers should
be able to use Arti to build Tor-powered software, and has incorporated
that thinking into its design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, it exports some crates that other developers can use in their
Rust projects, and has some documentation on them, including some basic
demonstration code snippets that you can follow along with at home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Arti is a fairly bleeding-edge project. It didn’t hit
version 1.0.0 too long ago, and due to the breakneck speed of
development, APIs are not set in stone. There is a lot of breakage that
could be potentially encountered by another developer.</p></li>
<li><p>In this project, I will be creating certain sample programs in
Rust using Arti’s APIs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal will be to build my sample programs and document any
difficulties that come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe certain APIs are hard to use, or undocumented, or certain
operations cause Arti to fail (exposing a bug). All these issues will be
brought to the notice of the Arti team and fixes can be discussed and
implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the project can get valuable feedback from an outsider
who doesn’t have much knowledge of the codebase and the way the Arti
proxy does things.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-dns-client">Fixing DNS client</h2>
<p>In the <a href="gsoc-week-1.html">last post</a>, I detailed how I got
a functioning DNS packet to be crafted with the help of Wireshark and a
teaching resource I found.</p>
<p>This time, I wanted to understand the meanings behind the “magic
numbers” I was sending. For this, <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/Diziet">Ian Jackson</a> suggested I
read <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035">RFC
1035</a>, all the way from 1987, which lays down the DNS protocol in its
entirety.</p>
<p>RFCs can be a bit scary since they need to very precisely define
protocols, edge cases and all, however 1035 was very readable. The scope
of this project means that I don’t have to build a full-fledged DNS
resolver, but can get away with limiting myself a bit (eg. to lookup A
records only), but the RFC explaned how in DNS over TCP, there are 2
bytes before the entire message which store the length of the DNS
message (payload and headers).</p>
<p>So, in the last example, what was actually happening was that
<code>0x00 0x33</code> stored the info that “this DNS packet will be of
51 bytes”, and by padding the entire message so that it was 53 bytes in
length (51 bytes for the message + 2 bytes to store the length), I was
validating this statement. Hence why any change in these two bytes or
not padding to 53 bytes was invalidating my packet in Wireshark.</p>
<p>Some other things I fixed were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There were some severe discrepancies in the types of certain
attributes, like the fact that NAME in Response was not being stored as
a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> or that the TTL was not an
<code>i32</code>. These were also addressed to comply with
standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Response parsing code was added so that more fields were
stored correctly, along with some checks on these values so that we get
a correct response code, or to store all the IP addresses that have been
sent to us, or to reconstruct the domain name from the Response
bytes.</p></li>
<li><p>We can take a command line argument now of what hostname we wish
to look up.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Display</code> trait was implemented so that we can print
the header and response to <code>stdout</code> nicely, with most fields
in hexadecimal representation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After this, I just some minor clean up work before switching to the
connection checker to make some progress there.</p>
<h2 id="printing-current-circuit-info">Printing Current Circuit
Info</h2>
<p>One feature of the connection checker I’d proposed is the ability to
see the current circuit being used by Arti.</p>
<p>Here, circuit refers to the three hops that your traffic will take
through the Tor Network before being sent to your destination. You can
view this in Tor Browser by clicking on the padlock next to the address
bar. It shows you the IP addresses of the nodes and the country in which
they reside. If you are connected using a bridge, it shows that instead
as well as the specific pluggable transport you may be using.</p>
<p>I asked about how we could implement this feature using Arti, and
here is where I learned something new: Tor Browser simplifies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tor creates multiple circuits when it initializes, both to help
meet the need of multiple circuits later on down the line and because
not every stream can be routed over one circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, a stream is a <code>DataStream</code> as exported by
<code>arti-client</code> (ie, analogous to
<code>TcpStream</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>In browsers, one page usually loads in resources from other
domains or different files on the same server. This means different
<code>DataStream</code>s for different resources and thus different
circuits.</p></li>
<li><p>So, if <code>example.com</code> loads in
<code>cdn.example.com/image.jpg</code>, for example, both these requests
may occur over different circuits entirely, and so the Tor Browser
circuit info is misleading since it won’t depict all these circuits
being used to render the page.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, Arti <em>can</em> give you the connection info for a particular
<code>DataStream</code>, but it will require the
<code>experimental-api</code> crate feature. After some finagling with
<code>Cargo.toml</code>, I got the required API running using
<code>experimental</code> crate feature instead (perhaps because some
other API that I indirectly called was using it?)</p>
<p>After that, it was just a matter of making a dummy request and
printing the circuit that was used for that.</p>
<h2 id="contributing-to-arti">Contributing to Arti</h2>
<p>During all of this, I was also trying to setup Snowflake connections
in the connection checker as well as the Arti proxy. For the proxy, it
is done by configuring <code>arti.toml</code>, which lives in
<code>~/.config/arti</code>.</p>
<p>A sample <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/blob/main/crates/arti/src/arti-example-config.toml">arti.toml</a>
is provided in the Arti repo for reference. It also contained
instructions on how to configure a bridge.</p>
<p>However, in a rush to configure Arti, I skipped over reading some of
these instructions and had created an invalid config.</p>
<p>You see, in the TOML, you’re supposed to configure bridges by writing
the following:</p>
<pre><code># Copied this and simplified from Arti&#39;s sample config, the below bridge is a dummy one and won&#39;t work
[bridges]
bridges = [ 
     &quot;obfs4 bridge.example.net:80 $0bac39417268b69b9f514e7f63fa6fba1a788958 ed25519:dGhpcyBpcyBbpmNyZWRpYmx5IHNpbGx5ISEhISEhISA iat-mode=1&quot;,
]

[[bridges.transports]]

# Which pluggable transports does this binary provide?
protocols = [&quot;obfs4&quot;]

# Path to the binary to be run.
path = &quot;/usr/bin/obfsproxy&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note: I try to explain what all this means as best I can, but if some
of the jargon doesn’t seem clear to you, I recommend reading <a
href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention">the Tor Project’s
guide on censorship circumvention</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The <code>[bridges]</code> section holds the bridge descriptor, which
is basically that long line of text which contains what type of bridge
it is, the IP:port and some authentication info so that we can be sure
we actually are connected to the bridge and not some impostor.</p>
<p>The <code>[[bridges.transports]]</code> section houses some more
additional info about pluggable transports, which are the different
protocols that Tor can use to connect to a bridge and in the process
defeat censors which block Tor connections. There are various bridge
types, including <code>obfs4</code> (like the one given above) and
<code>Snowflake</code>.</p>
<p>We can see in this section we have to give info on where the
pluggable transport binary is located and what type of pluggable
transport this is. This is because pluggable transports aren’t a part of
the Tor binary, or Arti. They are maintained and distributed separately.
For instance, the CLI version of Snowflake is written in Go.</p>
<p>So now comes the explaination of what I did wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I didn’t configure <code>[[bridges.transports]]</code> at all,
because I didn’t even see it, I just pasted a snowflake bridge into the
<code>[bridges]</code> section.</p></li>
<li><p>I also ignored the fact that Arti doesn’t have any code that
actually implements connecting to bridges, the <code>tor-ptmgr</code>
crate is just to call external pluggable transports and provide a Rust
interface to manage them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to help from <a href="https://trinity.fr.eu.org/">trinity</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/Diziet">Diziet</a>, who
helped me identify these issues, I got Arti to connect to a pluggable
transport.</p>
<p>However, I am actually glad I made these mistakes, since it
highlighted what someone else who is new to Arti may have done as well.
In particular, some weaknesses in the Arti docs (and one in the code)
were brought to our attention and some issues and corresponding MRs were
created to rectify these.</p>
<p>These were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/879">arti#879</a></p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/875">arti#875</a></p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1216">arti!1216</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I also opened up the following MR to try to let the user
know that pluggable transports weren’t setup right as a warning. (This
MR is in a draft stage at the time of writing and may have changed by
the time you click on it): <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1229">arti!1229</a></p>
<p>Also, while writing example code for Snowflake bridges, trinity
spotted a <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/878">bug</a>
in Arti.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this was a good week, I learned a lot about DNS, read an RFC
for the first time and even helped contribute to Arti, which involved
using a lot of <code>info!</code> messages and <code>grep</code> to
understand the flow of control in Arti.</p>
