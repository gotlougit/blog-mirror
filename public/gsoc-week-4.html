<h1 id="gsoc-2023-blog-3">GSoC 2023 Blog 3</h1>
<p>Hello there! This is the fourth in a series of blogposts detailing
the work I will be doing for the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor Project</a> as part of Google
Summer of Code 2023.</p>
<p>Here I will detail some of the work I did during some period of time,
the challenges I faced and the outcomes of that work.</p>
<h2 id="brief-intro-on-my-project">Brief Intro on My Project</h2>
<p>The project I was selected for is titled “Arti API exploration to
build example tools”.</p>
<p>Confused? Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arti is the Rust rewrite of the Tor software that allows you to
make TCP connections through the Tor Network, run Tor relays and bridges
etc. You can read more about it <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti">from its
repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Arti was built in mind with the goal that other developers should
be able to use Arti to build Tor-powered software, and has incorporated
that thinking into its design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, it exports some crates that other developers can use in their
Rust projects, and has some documentation on them, including some basic
demonstration code snippets that you can follow along with at home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Arti is a fairly bleeding-edge project. It didn’t hit
version 1.0.0 too long ago, and due to the breakneck speed of
development, APIs are not set in stone. There is a lot of breakage that
could be potentially encountered by another developer.</p></li>
<li><p>In this project, I will be creating certain sample programs in
Rust using Arti’s APIs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal will be to build my sample programs and document any
difficulties that come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe certain APIs are hard to use, or undocumented, or certain
operations cause Arti to fail (exposing a bug). All these issues will be
brought to the notice of the Arti team and fixes can be discussed and
implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the project can get valuable feedback from an outsider
who doesn’t have much knowledge of the codebase and the way the Arti
proxy does things.</p>
<h2 id="documenting-the-dns-resolver">Documenting the DNS resolver</h2>
<p>I worked on the notes I’d gotten on the DNS resolver this week,
mainly to document everything. During this process I mainly got used to
the <code>rustdocs</code> convention of documenting my code and also
setup a clippy rule to warn me in case any method had missing
documentation.</p>
<p>I ended up documenting structs, their fields and a couple functions,
as well as adding some introductory text detailing the DNS resolver
project’s objective and a warning that this homegrown DNS implementation
really wasn’t meant to be used anywhere in production, but rather served
as a demonstration that <em>any</em> homegrown network protocol could be
subbed in and served over Tor using the Arti APIs.</p>
<p>This was a fun exercise, and I will expand the other projects’
documentation in the coming weeks as well.</p>
<h2 id="changing-return-type-for-parsing-methods">Changing return type
for parsing methods</h2>
<p>In the DNS resolver, there is a trait called <code>FromBytes</code>
that is implemented for the structs <code>Header</code> (which is the
DNS header represented as a struct), <code>Query</code> (which is the
DNS header + query), <code>ResourceRecord</code> (which can be thought
of as containing the answer for a query) and <code>Response</code>
(which is just the header + query + one or more resource records).</p>
<p>This <code>FromBytes</code> trait defines a method
<code>from_bytes()</code> which takes in a slice of bytes and returns
the initialized struct. As the name implies, all the values for the
fields will be taken from the bytes passed to this method.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with this method was that it passes the struct no
matter what. Even if we give invalid byte sequence to the method, we
will get a struct. This is highly dangerous since we don’t have any way
to handle invalid byte sequences or convey this message to functions
lower down the call stack.</p>
<p>Hence, I decided to change the return type from <code>Self</code>
(the struct itself) to <code>Option&lt;Self&gt;</code> (Option is an
enum which either returns <code>Some&lt;Self&gt;</code> or
<code>None</code>, hence we can denote the error condition using
<code>None</code> and a valid struct using <code>Some</code>).</p>
<p>However, since this is a trait, <code>Self</code> can be a variable
sized struct, and Rust doesn’t like that. So, we wrap it inside a
<code>Box</code> (really just a very simple pointer setup, the
<code>Box</code> will contain a reference to wherever the struct is
located on the heap so we can pass the <code>Box</code> around easily
and cheaply and also be aware of its size)</p>
<p>Hence the final return type becomes
<code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Self&gt;&gt;</code> which is a cleaner API than
just returning <code>Self</code> This also has the nice side effect that
the DNS resolver doesn’t crash when I make a request for a domain name
that isn’t registered!</p>
<h2 id="handling-timeouts-in-download-manager">Handling timeouts in
download manager</h2>
<p>For this week, I intended to work on adding resume capabilities for
the download manager, ie, if I were to abruptly cut off network
connection and later restart the download manager, I should be able to
pick up my download where I left off.</p>
<p>However, I did notice a feature that was in a way more important:
retrying requests. See, when I configured the download manager to use
Snowflake to download Tor Browser, I would see a lot of failed circuits
and timeouts. This also happened when I used a normal Tor connection,
but to a much lesser extent.</p>
<p>So, to address this pitfall, I simply decided I wanted to check if we
got anything back from the network and if not, just re-run the code that
makes the request using recursion.</p>
<p>However, Rust doesn’t permit asynchronous recursive functions, likely
because it will make the call stack very weird, so I ended up just doing
it iteratively instead. The code now tries up to six times to make the
same request and if it doesn’t work after all that, it just gives
up.</p>
<p>This has made the download manager much more robust, as I do see that
on occasion one or two requests do indeed trigger a retry.</p>
<h2 id="more-channel-api-being-exposed">More Channel API being
exposed</h2>
<p>While working on the obfs4 connection checker, it was suggested that
<code>ChanMgr</code> not be used, and instead a lower level API would be
more suitable, since <code>ChanMgr</code> does some setup steps that are
just irrelevant for this use case.</p>
<p>The <code>ChannelFactory</code> trait in <code>tor-chanmgr</code>
defines an interface through which I can build a channel. Exposing this
in <code>ChanMgr</code> will allow me to directly create a Channel. This
API is exposed in <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1374">this
MR</a> and is currently not merged.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This week was also fairly eventful, I ended up working on a lot of
the review notes I got on the DNS resolver, fix up download manager,
learn and work around the Rust compiler’s rules to implement better
design practices in my programs and made another MR upstream.</p>
