<h1 id="migrating-to-nixos">Migrating to NixOS</h1>
<p>I’ve been running Fedora for the past 2 years, and while I think that
of the mainstream distros, it is the most beginner-friendly and stable
system to run, I have been running into some pains while using it. I
realized that I have been suffering from configuration drift, which is
basically when you fix some issue by configuring it so in some obscure,
easy-to-forget configuration file in <code>/etc/</code> or even some
config file in <code>~/.config/</code>, and when you reinstall your
system, you have to do this all over again.</p>
<p>I’ve also been experimenting a lot with system defaults, and when I
get stuff wrong it can also leave my system in a broken state for a
while which is not ideal for situations when I need stuff to work and
don’t have time to debug.</p>
<p>To solve this, I have migrated to <a
href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-nixos">What is NixOS?</h3>
<p>NixOS is a Linux distro with a very, very unique philosophy: having a
purely functional language (called Nix) be the lanugage in which you
write all about your Linux system: your hardware (ie, what kernel
modules and options you want), your software (everything from the
bootloader to even the plugins inside your browser), and all their
configuration options. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write <code>systemd</code> services</p></li>
<li><p>Add allowed SSH keys</p></li>
<li><p>Create build instructions for software</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/">Erase
your entire system and regenerate your system from scratch on
boot</a></p></li>
<li><p>And more!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NixOS seemed like an ideal way to manage my configs, both user and
system-wide.</p>
<h3 id="pre-install">Pre-Install</h3>
<p>First, I downloaded NixOS and tried to create an automated installer
that would automatically partition my system and install NixOS with a
custom <code>configuration.nix</code> that I ended up workshopping for a
couple of days. (This file, by the way, basically houses all the
system-wide configurations that NixOS uses to build the system, like
what bootloader you want, what drives and partitions you have, the users
you want premade on the system, user packages you want installed for
that user, system services you want running, and so on and so forth)</p>
<p>The customizations I’ve done include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use dnscrypt-proxy2 instead of systemd-resolved for DNS resolving.
This way, I can use DNS over HTTPS instead of DNS over TLS, which is
less likely to be blocked and allows me to make DNS requests in a secure
fashion in more situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default my config uses Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver, which
will most likely not be blocked by good networks and is private enough
for my uses.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use systemd-boot instead of GRUB for bootloader. This is just to
try out something new, and since I hardly ever mess with bootloaders, I
don’t really care either way for this preference.</p></li>
<li><p>Download various command line utilities and graphical
applications which I use. This includes compilers, LSPs, browsers, music
players etc. In this way, I can keep track of everything on my system at
all times and not have to resort to parse DNF transaction history every
time I wish to do a clean install. It also allows me to delete any
packages that I feel are a waste of space easily.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the section of the config that is most in flux, since I
didn’t get all the packages that I use written down in one go. So, I’ve
been adding to the list ever since depending on my need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use zstd compression on BTRFS partition for easy space savings. zstd
feels like it breaks the laws of physics sometimes, it achieves very
good compression rates but takes negligible CPU cycles to decompress
when the time comes to access the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did debate using ZFS since NixOS’s unique nature would make it one
of the easiest distros to use ZFS, but ultimately went with BTRFS since
I felt there wasn’t really too much difference either way for a single
disk, no RAID system and I already had an external hard drive formatted
with BTRFS.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PipeWire and Wireplumber for audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Syncthing for easy file sync between devices and as a kind of
backup for irreplaceable files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: NixOS is all about reproducibility. However, that traditionally
only extended to packages, not their versions etc. If you use my
<code>configuration.nix</code> at two different times, you will most
likely get different builds because the packages’ versions will be
slightly different. Flakes allow you to “pin” the version numbers in a
way, enabling true reproducibility. They’re also used in other
utilities, like home-manager, which we’ll get to shortly. I don’t have
my config migrated to flakes right now, but I will soon!</p>
<p>In the meantime, I also used <code>rsync</code> to backup my home
folder to an external hard drive in order to keep my user configs (or at
least, the ones I cared about) and data. (I tried using
<code>btrfs send/receive</code> but I was running into some problems and
I already had an <code>rsync</code>-based backup script)</p>
<p>The installer was jointly created by ChatGPT and tweaks from looking
at blogs on NixOS, as well as the small customizations I made myself.
However, it would never work. (My best guess is that I was using the
wrong mountpoint for my EFI partition, but I was on a deadline to
install NixOS due to other committments so I never tested this)</p>
<p>I wound up using the default installer that came with the KDE image
of NixOS and pasting my configuration in the now live system. This time
it worked, although I did have to workshop a couple things as well,
including shifting to NixOS unstable by changing channels.</p>
<h3 id="home-manager">Home-Manager</h3>
<p>Now that we have packages setup in a reproducible way, let’s do the
same for config files. This was much harder than I expected.</p>
<p>First, we setup <a
href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Home_Manager">Home-Manager</a>, which is a
tool to manage the home folder configs. It allows you to specify user
packages, write config files directly in a .nix file, and also point to
read-only versions of configs for certain programs (like, say, Git).</p>
<p>Doing so is very easy. For example,</p>
<pre><code>home.file = {
    &quot;.config/gh&quot; = {
      source = /home/gotlou/dotfiles/gh;
      recursive = true;
    };
}</code></pre>
<p>tells home-manager to create a read-only symlink at
<code>~/.config/gh</code> to <code>~/dotfiles/gh</code> and have it do
the same recursively (ie, for every subfolder and file within
<code>~/dotfiles/gh</code>).</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Impermanence">Impermanence’s
list of files</a> as well as casually glancing through my old
<code>~/</code> for config files that seemed important, and added them
to home-manager sequentially.</p>
<h4 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h4>
<p>There was a small hiccup with Syncthing that bears mention. I just
copied over the Syncthing config, which includes the database and the
private key used for identification and authentication, but syncthing
wouldn’t start.</p>
<p>In order to get it to work, you need to force Syncthing to rescan the
files using the command <code>syncthing --reset-database</code>. Don’t
worry, this won’t lose any data, but it will just “clean up” Syncthing a
bit and it should work now.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future work</h3>
<p>Okay, so my time ran out to install NixOS. I had to get everything
running under a busy weekend with other places to be and things to do,
and this was the most I could do. Pretty good, all things
considered.</p>
<p>I plan to get read-write permissions on the dotfiles using
Impermanence (mentioned above) and Erase Your Darlings, which is just
the nickname I give to erasing your entire system, save for a couple of
folders, and rebuilding system at boot. I could also mount / on tmpfs, I
expect it won’t eat much RAM since it is ultimately a bunch of text and
some symlinks to stuff stored on the SSD, but I’ll have to investigate
this a bit further</p>
<p>In this way, I will end up with a system whose entire configuration
is defined in the contents stored in one single folder, my home folder
will basically just contain personal files and dotfiles won’t really be
stored in there, and one or two config files will contain the details
about my system (services, users, packages etc)</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I really really like NixOS, even if I haven’t set it up yet
completely.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It feels faster than my old Fedora install. Boot times are lower
and program startup speed is higher too. Maybe this is “new computer
smell” at work, but if I implement Erase Your Darlings I can pretty much
ensure this</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that I can boot into an older generation if nothing
works on the latest update gives me immense peace of mind. The
declarative nature of the config file means I can very easily experiment
with new tech stacks on my system (like swapping out DNS resolvers)
without really having to be in the following situation:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“OK, did I disable that old service? Does NetworkManager know about
it? Is it still being run in memory? Why is my machine not booting
now?”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><code>nix-shell</code> allows you to specify libraries that you
wish to use in your current shell. Basically, it is Python virtual
environment but done better and for the entire shell. I use it to manage
libraries needed by various Rust projects for example.</p></li>
<li><p><code>nix-shell -p package</code> allows you to get
<code>package</code> temporarily installed in that shell only so you can
try it out and use it without altering your
<code>configuration.nix</code>. The required files are cached in
<code>/nix/store</code>, so you can later use them, but they are not
made available to general usage. For that, use
<code>nix-env -iA package</code>, although this defeats the purpose of
NixOS since this change is not recorded in your
<code>configuration.nix</code> or any similar files.</p></li>
<li><p>Stuff “just works” right now on my machine. If I boot into a
certain generation, I can be guaranteed that that generation will
perform the same as it did yesterday, so if an update borks something, I
can just boot into an older generation as a workaround and wait for a
fix or fix it myself depending on the issue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend playing with NixOS in a VM and building your config
there, then installing it on real hardware and see the magic happen
before your eyes: the same machine as in the VM, made using one or two
files. Goodbye, tedious Linux install and setup time!</p>
<p>If you want to view my configuration, you can check out the <a
href="https://git.sr.ht/~gotlou/nix-config">repo</a> and a mirror on <a
href="https://github.com/gotlougit/nix-config">GitHub</a>. I tried to
lay it out very very easily, and there is even a script which automates
getting the system config into the stock KDE system you get after using
the KDE GUI installer.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/maan2003">Manmeet Singh</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/getpsyched">Priyanshu Tripathi</a> for also
doing the switch with me! They helped me set up everything, get started
with NixOS and helped avoid any pain points they had thanks to their
experience in setting it up as well.</p>
