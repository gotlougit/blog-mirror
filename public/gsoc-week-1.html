<h1 id="gsoc-2023-blog-1">GSoC 2023 Blog 1</h1>
<p>Hello there! This will be the first of many blogposts detailing the
work I will be doing for the <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor
Project</a> as part of Google Summer of Code 2023.</p>
<p>Here I will detail some of the work I did during some period of time,
the challenges I faced and the outcomes of that work.</p>
<h2 id="brief-intro-on-my-project">Brief Intro on My Project</h2>
<p>The project I was selected for is titled “Arti API exploration to
build example tools”.</p>
<p>Confused? Let’s break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Arti is the Rust rewrite of the Tor software that allows you to
make TCP connections through the Tor Network, run Tor relays and bridges
etc. You can read more about it <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti">from its
repository</a></p></li>
<li><p>Arti was built in mind with the goal that other developers should
be able to use Arti to build Tor-powered software, and has incorporated
that thinking into its design.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, it exports some crates that other developers can use in their
Rust projects, and has some documentation on them, including some basic
demonstration code snippets that you can follow along with at home.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>However, Arti is a fairly bleeding-edge project. It didn’t hit
version 1.0.0 too long ago, and due to the breakneck speed of
development, APIs are not set in stone. There is a lot of breakage that
could be potentially encountered by another developer.</p></li>
<li><p>In this project, I will be creating certain sample programs in
Rust using Arti’s APIs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My goal will be to build my sample programs and document any
difficulties that come up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe certain APIs are hard to use, or undocumented, or certain
operations cause Arti to fail (exposing a bug). All these issues will be
brought to the notice of the Arti team and fixes can be discussed and
implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, the project can get valuable feedback from an outsider
who doesn’t have much knowledge of the codebase and the way the Arti
proxy does things.</p>
<h2 id="reorganizing-work-repository">Reorganizing work repository</h2>
<p>A bit before the GSoC contributor applications opened up, I <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/gotlou/arti-sample-projects">created
a repo</a> which housed my attempt at building something using
<code>arti-client</code> and <code>arti-hyper</code>: A download manager
which would download Tor Browser from the Tor Project website.</p>
<p>Now, I only opened this up to play around with the existing APIs, but
I’d actually found <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/779">a
bug</a> on my first day.</p>
<p>I continued to hack on this project and even included it in my
proposal, both to link to and to continue to work on in the GSoC work
period.</p>
<p>I have worked on the project for a bit and now it is able to create
six different circuits through the Tor Network (so that means requests
go through six different exit nodes) and download the Linux version of
Tor Browser through Tor.</p>
<p>Now that I have been selected, it would probably be a good idea to
use this repo to house all my work for this summer, not just the
download manager.</p>
<p>To do this, I looked to the Arti repo for inspiration.</p>
<p>Arti’s main repo houses all the crates that Arti needs or exports.
The root directory of the repository has a <code>crates/</code> folder
which has all the different crates in it.</p>
<p>The <code>Cargo.toml</code> in the root directory is configured to
create a cargo workspace, which means that it tells cargo that there are
multiple crates inside this one repo.</p>
<p>Once I added my projects inside the <code>crates</code> folder, I was
able to declare which one I wanted to run using
<code>cargo run --bin &lt;crate-name&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="making-connections-through-bridges">Making connections through
bridges</h2>
<p>At this point, the download manager was working well, and I wanted to
further enhance it by working to add pluggable transport support to it.
However, I was not too familiar with the APIs so I pivoted to working on
one of the smaller projects in my proposal: a connection checker tool
which just tries to connect to a website through Tor via a normal Tor
connection, a bridge or obfs4 or Snowflake bridge.</p>
<p>This tool was specifically chosen to be built by me in order to
better gauge Arti’s bridge APIs, and while developing this tool I did
find some useful feedback for the Arti devs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There wasn’t really any example code given to connect to a
Snowflake proxy. I brought this to the attention of the Arti devs and <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/875">filed an
issue</a> since this wasn’t something I could’ve fixed myself. It is
addressed in <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1216">this
MR</a></p></li>
<li><p>The example code I was using did not actually work, this was due
to the process not getting an exclusive lock on the cache for the
directory info that Arti can share with multiple instances. While normal
Arti usage can share this cache info, when using bridges this falls
apart and is <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/issues/611">a known
bug</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since there were some issues with getting bridges working, I shifted
to something else.</p>
<h2 id="making-error-reporting-easier-for-new-developers">Making error
reporting easier for new developers</h2>
<p>When reporting this issue over IRC, nickm suggested using
<code>tor_error::Report</code> to generate an error message instead of
copy pasting panic output or even the Display trait’s output</p>
<p>This was the first I saw of this trait, and it took some delving into
<code>tor-error</code>’s docs to figure out how to use it.</p>
<p>Essentially, <code>tor_error::Report</code> implements the
<code>report()</code> method, which generates a nice, easy to understand
error message from the error that has been caught.</p>
<p>So, instead of writing</p>
<pre><code>function_which_fails().unwrap();</code></pre>
<p>and looking at a complicated panic, you can write</p>
<pre><code>match function_which_fails() {
  Ok(_) =&gt; {
    // some code here
  },
  Err(e) =&gt; {
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, e.report());
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now knowing this trait was there for Arti’s APIs, it would’ve made
debugging much easier. So, I created <a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/-/merge_requests/1213">an
MR</a> to add a section on Error Reporting in the docs for
<code>arti-client</code></p>
<p>Now that this was done, I worked on another project under the
proposal.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-the-dns-resolver">Working on the DNS resolver</h2>
<p>Since the download manager had gotten enough work for a while and the
connection checker was stalled, I decided to work on the DNS resolver,
which was a sample program I chose specifically to highlight how
non-HTTP(S) TCP-based protocols might utilize Arti to make their
connections anonymous.</p>
<p>The DNS resolver will use DNS over TCP to make a query to a DNS
server for a particular domain.</p>
<p>I researched the protocol and found that DNS over TCP was virtually
identical to regular UDP-based DNS.</p>
<p><a
href="https://mislove.org/teaching/cs4700/spring11/handouts/project1-primer.pdf">This
teaching resource</a> helped me understand the DNS header and payload
generation, and even provided some dummy values I could use to validate
my DNS request.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was write the structs according to the
definitions given in the above teaching resource, which I
cross-referenced across various other sources.</p>
<p>After that, I resorted to looking for some crate which could directly
serialize and deserialize the structs into <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code>,
however, after trying <code>serde</code> and <code>bincode</code> I
realized that these crates all used their own bespoke format, and I’d
have to just manually write the code to serialize and deserialize.</p>
<p>In order to do that, I defined a trait <code>AsBytes</code> which has
<code>as_bytes()</code> method to be implemented by both
<code>Header</code> and <code>Query</code> structs (which represent the
DNS header and query message respectively)</p>
<p>After this was done and I was able to verify that the method worked
as intended, I ran into another roadblock: I was getting a response of 0
bytes every time.</p>
<p>While at first I did directly send these bytes over Tor, I later
resorted to using <code>tokio::net::UdpSocket</code> or
<code>tokio::net::TcpStream</code> in order to validate my crafted
request. This was a good step, since Wireshark would reveal that my
packet was not, in fact, valid.</p>
<p>I’d first dropped down from Tor to TCP, but when even that didn’t
really work I went down to UDP. It was here that Wireshark revealed that
my packet was a mangled UDP packet.</p>
<p>Apparently, some values weren’t set right, so after fixing that and
verifiying in Wireshark, I went up to TCP. Here is where the statement
“DNS over TCP was virtually identical to regular UDP-based DNS” falls
apart.</p>
<p>The only real differences I could see from my packet and what
<code>dig</code> generates for DNS over TCP was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two bytes being added before my DNS message starts:
<code>0x00 0x33</code>. I just added these in using
<code>.push()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The entire TCP payload being of 53 bytes. The <code>dig</code>
command accomplished this by making an additional request, but adding
support for this seemed to be a bit beyond the objective of this
project, so I (at first) <em>copied the bytes from Wireshark and
appended them to the Vec I was sending over the network</em>. When this
worked, I experimented and found if I simply sent a 53 byte packet, even
I padded them with <code>0x00</code>, it would be recognized as a DNS
packet.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I don’t really know why this happens. Keep in mind, I was
sending the <em>same exact</em> payload over UDP and TCP, yet the
previous iteration (without these hacks) only worked in UDP and not in
TCP.</p>
<p>Now, even after doing this, I was able to see that even though my
machine gets a response back, all that my Rust program saw was zeroes. I
later figured out that by fixing the size of the buffer I used to store
the response, I would get the response.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This week was just the start, and I’ve been learning something new
almost every day. Here’s to more progress in the coming weeks and more
improvements to Arti!</p>
