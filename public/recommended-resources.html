<h1 id="recommended-resources">Recommended Resources</h1>
<h2 id="hiddennot-so-hidden-gems-of-the-internet">Hidden/Not-So-Hidden Gems of the Internet</h2>
<p>These are mainly resources that I have used myself and have found to be pretty good. I also keep this link active to quickly find these resources again instead of searching for them.</p>
<h3 id="learning-stuff">Learning Stuff</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">Teach Yourself CS</a>: This website contains the best recommendations about resources to learn Computer Science, the subject. It contains both book and video lecture recommendations, so both types of learners can benefit. Use this to get a good command of the theory (and some basic implementation details) of computers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">Harvard CS50</a>: I don’t exactly recommend this course for absolute beginners since it’s a little heavy on the details, but for someone who’s done with the beginner stages and has mastered their first language, this is a pretty good cross-section of programming. The exercises are not your typical “print 5 numbers in a row” questions, but are pretty cool mini projects in themselves, like photo filters, recovering deleted images from an SD card etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x">Build Your Own X</a>: This GitHub repo houses ideas and links to guides to, er, build your own X, whether that be a game, an operating system, or something in between! Look here for ideas to build your next project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>: They offer courses from some of the best colleges in the world <em>for free</em> (a small portion of the courses are paid, and some features are locked behind a paywall like getting certificates, but a lot of the knowledge here is freely available).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scratch-an-itch">Scratch an itch</h3>
<p>I don’t have a better way to describe these other than just links which help solve some very specific problems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.tunefind.com/">Tunefind</a>: This website allows you to find the music that plays when X happens in Y (where Y is a movie, TV show, even game). Before I found this website I had to pretty much resort to chance that someone in a Youtube comment for that scene commented how that song fit the scene perfectly or something like that. For TV shows, it has an episode by episode listing where it gives the song and then a scene description that can tell you what song matches to what scene.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://plexus.techlore.tech/">Check apps for MicroG compatibility</a>: If you use MicroG or an Ungoogled Android smartphone, but need to see if a certain app will run on your phone, this is the resource for you. You can submit reports as well (through GitHub) on apps that may have not been reported.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14290113/ddg#14290145">Push code to multiple remotes in git</a>: I frequently mirror to SourceHut and GitHub, and this trick helps keep both of them in sync instead of having to use 2 push commands or a manual import of the code from one repo to another.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/">Good info about all software licenses</a>: This isn’t legal advice, but it gives you a brief overview of the pros and cons of each license so you can choose the one you see best for each project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://classic.copetti.org/writings/consoles/">Learn about lots of game consoles’ architectures</a>: A somewhat famous website for this, it goes in-depth about the ins and outs of each console with detailed information.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.devdungeon.com/content/gpg-tutorial#basic_usage">GPG command line tutorial on basic steps</a>: Whenever I need to use GPG, I can just use this.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server">Use SSH key-based login</a>: Whenever I need to do this on a machine, I can just follow these steps</p></li>
</ul>
