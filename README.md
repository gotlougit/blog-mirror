# Personal Website

This is the git repo for my personal website. It includes a couple scripts to easily interface with [blog-helper](https://sr.ht/~gotlou/blog-helper), a tool I developed to easily create formatted pages as per your custom templates.

If you want to poke and peek around, you can, but I just use this repo to keep a backup of my website.
