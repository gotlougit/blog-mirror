<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Saksham Mittal, though I go by <code>gotlou</code> online. I am an avid computer programmer, Linux enthusiast and privacy advocate. I am proficient in Python, dabble in HTML &amp; CSS occasionally and am teaching myself Go and shell scripting at the moment.</p>
<p>I am amazed by the power of the Internet, and the unprecedented access to information that it allows one to access for the modest cost of an Internet connection and a device to access it on. Inspired by those that have come before, I decided to start this blog to share information I encounter, whether it’s about pre-existing programs to solve a problem or a new program I created to do something.</p>
<p>In this vein, I enjoy running and writing free and open source software, since I can see how the program works, make my own modifications to it, or even add new features to it. A shell script or Python program is a good example of this; I find Python is an extremely flexible language and is easy to get started with. If you want to learn programming, I would suggest Python as it gets most of the complexities out of the way so you can learn the concepts first.</p>
<p>Besides computers, I enjoy reading comfortably with a nice breeze in the air, listening to music, riding a bike, and Lord of The Rings. Hopefully I’ll add blogging to this list as well ;)</p>
