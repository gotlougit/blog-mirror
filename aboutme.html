<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Saksham Mittal, though I go by <code>gotlou</code> online. I am an avid computer enthusiast and programmer, and I am proficient in Python, dabble in HTML &amp; CSS occasionally and am teaching myself Go at the moment.</p>
<p>I am a strong supporter of free and open source software, Internet freedom and the unprecedented access to ideas, information and viewpoints that it allows humanity to access. It is thanks to the Internet that I am able to type these words in one small room in a corner of the world and then have those words transmit to you irrespective of your location. All one needs is an Internet connection and a device to run a web browser of some kind on. That, to me, is amazing. It is thanks to this access to information that I was able to learn Python, and learn about Linux by myself for virtually nothing.</p>
<p>I am also a strong advocate of electronic privacy, and so run privacy-respecting, free and open source software, and in cases where I don’t really have a choice (for example, videoconferencing software like the ones used for the past year and a half), I try to quarantine them as best I can.</p>
<p>Besides computers, I enjoy reading comfortably with a nice breeze in the air, listening to music, riding a bike, and Lord of The Rings. Hopefully I’ll add blogging to this list as well ;)</p>
