<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Saksham Mittal. I have been fascinated by computers from a very early age. It’s pretty mindblowing to imagine that this one tool can do so many different tasks and how seamless it is to move from one task to another, like watching TV after a Zoom meeting, for example. The number of possibilities only increases once someone is introduced to scripting, programming, etc. Because of this, I’ve learned numerous skills, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Programming (in Python, C and a little bit of C++)</p></li>
<li><p>Very basic web design (I’m hoping this website helps me learn more).</p></li>
<li><p>Familiarity with Linux. I like Linux due to it’s developer-friendly nature and a nice way to get more performance on low spec machines, not to mention the free software philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>Some basic shell scripting, Markdown, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Contributing to open source projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Being a fast learner certainly helps, along with a lack of hesitancy in trying out new things.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve begun to learn more about how computers work as time goes on, and will write more about this here. It’s really a fascinating subject. I hope to build some cool software myself, learn more and share some tips/tricks/guides on how I did so.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-started-this-blog">Why I started this blog</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>There are really good resources offered on the Internet if you know where to look, and I hope I can help point you to those places, or even become a source myself.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to improve my writing and communication skills, and blogging is a pretty good way of doing so.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning more about web technologies (as previously mentioned).</p></li>
<li><p>To carve out a space for myself on the Internet.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommended-resources">Recommended Resources</h2>
<p>These are mainly learning resources that I have used myself and have found to be pretty good.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com">Teach Yourself CS</a>: This website contains the best recommendations about resources to learn Computer Science, the subject. It contains both book and video lecture recommendations, so both types of learners can benefit. Use this to get a good command of the theory (and some basic implementation details) of computers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/">Harvard CS50</a>: I don’t exactly recommend this course for absolute beginners since it’s a little heavy on the details, but for someone who’s done with the beginner stages and has mastered their first language, this is a pretty good cross-section of programming. The exercises are not your typical “print 5 numbers in a row” questions, but are pretty cool mini projects in themselves, like photo filters, recovering deleted images from an SD card etc.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x">Build Your Own X</a>: This GitHub repo houses ideas and links to guides to, er, build your own X, whether that be a game, an operating system, or something in between!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>: They offer courses from some of the best colleges in the world <em>for free</em> (a small portion of the courses are paid, and some features are locked behind a paywall like getting certificates, but a lot of the knowledege here is freely available).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contact-info">Contact Info</h2>
<p>You can email me at gotlouemail AT gmail DOT com. This is the email I generally use for git commits as well as signing up for mailing lists, so it’s public at this point.</p>
<p>Email me about:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suggestions on the website (formatting, accessibility issues etc.). I would really like to learn more about web development.</p></li>
<li><p>Any corrections I need to make. I always love to learn from my mistakes!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t email me about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asking for my financial help in case you are the son of the King of a country and will reward me handsomely in exchange</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-hosting">Code hosting</h2>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/gotlougit">GitHub account</a> where I host my code primarily. I also have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gotlougit">GitLab account</a> where I mirror my code as well. I do this in order to keep a backup of my projects in case anything ever happens to any one of the accounts, and also because while GitHub gets me eyes, I like using GitLab more due to the fact that I can just create a private repo just using Git, which helps ensure that my code is backed up, regardless if I ever want anyone else to see it or not.</p>
